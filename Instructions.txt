1. To compile the code yourself, import this project into Eclipse.
>> If only the source files are found, follow the instructions to download OpenCV and import its Java API here:

*http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/java_eclipse/java_eclipse.html

Though the example uses 2.4, the process is entirely the same for 3.1, which I used for this project.

2. Once imported, run FaceRec.java and enjoy circles on your face.

* If it crashes your display driver for any reason, try replacing the Haar cascade XML file for eye/glasses detection. The program uses the version from "opencv\sources\data\haarcascades_cuda" by default; as such, you should replace it with the one in the default haarcascades folder. Should it still fail, though unlikely, you could also try replacing the face detection file; I used the one from the default haarcascades folder.

* To close the program properly, don't just close the window, but also stop the program manually from the console. This program was written (or rather, ported) on pre-Thanksgiving hell week when everyone and their mothers put their deadlines on one day, and I could not be arsed to implement event listeners.

A video example of this program can be found in this link:
